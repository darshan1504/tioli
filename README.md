Flutter Web Application

Installation steps	

Since web support is still a technical preview, you need the latest in-development version of Flutter, also referred to as the master channel. In the root folder of the Tiolo repository, run the following commands:

    flutter channel master
    flutter upgrade

The upgrade process may take a few minutes. Next, you will need to enable web support in your Flutter installation so that it is available to this and other apps you develop on this workstation:

    flutter config --enable-web
    flutter devices

Once web support is enabled, you will see a new Chrome device in the device list. Restart Visual Studio Code after running these commands to refresh the device list menu if you donâ€™t see Chrome in that list yet.

To add web support to the Tiolo app, you need to run this command in the top-level folder of the tioli repository:

    flutter create .
    flutter run -d chrome


Common issue which you can come accross

If came accross following issue:
'The current Flutter SDK version is 1.9.1+hotfix.6. Because app_name depends on shared_preferences >=0.5.4+9 which requires Flutter SDK version >=1.10.0 <2.0.0, version solving failed. pub get failed (1)'

    Run "flutter upgrade" and this should fix your issue

Then follow the above installation instructions


**Important

Before performing any command update the launch.json file so that you can run the application on web

Add "args": ["-d", "<device name from adb devices output>"] under configurations  
 
{
    "version": "x.x.x",
    "configurations": [
        {
            "name": "Flutter",
            "request": "launch",
            "type": "dart",
            "args": ["-d", "<device name from adb devices output>"]
        }
    ]
}
